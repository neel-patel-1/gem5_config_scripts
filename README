Run all system configs for a single benchmark
./run_all_bench.sh <bench_config_file.sh>
 - see parsec_streamcluster_config.sh and spec_mcf_config.sh for examples of bench_config_file.sh
 - copy all system configuration scripts to run from source_benchs/ into runnable/ (run_all_bench.sh script will run all of these for the provided bench_config_file.sh)

Run all cpu types and collect memory bandwidth and cpu utilization for the cpu type
./profile_cpus.sh <benchmark_config.sh>
 - see parsec_streamcluster_config.sh and spec_mcf_config.sh for examples of bench_config_file.sh
 - copy all system configuration scripts to run from app_profiling/ into runnable_cpu_profile/ (run_all_bench.sh script will run all of these for the provided bench_config_file.sh)
