    Retiring: 82.2% of Pipeline Slots
     | A high fraction of pipeline slots was utilized by useful work. While the
     | goal is to make this metric value as big as possible, a high Retiring
     | value for non-vectorized code could prompt you to consider code
     | vectorization. Vectorization enables doing more computations without
     | significantly increasing the number of instructions, thus improving the
     | performance. Note that this metric value may be highlighted due to
     | Microcode Sequencer (MS) issue, so the performance can be improved by
     | avoiding using the MS.

        Light Operations: 81.1% of Pipeline Slots
         | CPU retired light-weight operations (ones which require no more than
         | one uop) in a significant fraction of cycles. This correlates with
         | total number of instructions used by the program. Optimum value of
         | uops-per-instruction ratio is 1. While this is the most desirable
         | metric, high values can also provide opportunities for performance
         | optimizations.

             | For a significant fraction of pipeline slots the CPU was retiring

             | This metric represents a non-floating-point (FP) uop fraction the
             | CPU has executed. If your application has no FP operations, this
             | is likely to be the biggest fraction.
